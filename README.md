**Calminder**

Studies show that spending only 2 hours outside a week can drastically improve our mental health. In the modern day and age, we spend too much time on our phones, computers, and inside in general. This is a problem especially applicable to students, often bogged down in classes and homework. This can often leave students with little time to go outside. With Calminder, you don't have to schedule outside time yourself- it is automatically and smartly worked into your schedule.
The API balances the time of day and the duration of the gap in schedule to find the optimal break for you to spend outside. 


*note*
the frontend of this project is not yet linked to the backend. the frontend is a prototype, we ran out of time to fully implement it.
